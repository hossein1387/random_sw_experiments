\subsection{Hamming Distance}

Hamming distance of two integers, each 32 bits wide, is the number of bits that the two number are in difference(?!). Minimum hamming distance is the minimum number of changes that are necessary to change one integer to another. In other words, if A and B are two 32 bits integer, the minimum hamming distance between the two is as follow:

\begin{equation}
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 1$$
\end{equation}
